1) Most parts printed with 3 wall counts and 30% unfill.

2) A 470µF electroltytic capacitor was added across MP1584 output to absorb ESP32 current spikes during communication.

3) Real world rotors can be balanced with mandrels using tubing or treaded rod as core and 3D printed adapters to hold component to it.

4) CLEAR "sine" like waveforms are crucial to balancing with HS-ACC. I used the following settings:

400 sample rate
33 Hz Low Pass Filter  3rd ORDER
±16g scale

5) E18-D80NK is a proximity sensor. With potentiometer carefully adjusted performs quite well for this.

6) You'll find STLs for IR bracket options using heavy gauge coat hanger wire. Wire is bent sharply 180º unto itself for about 13mm and inserted into brackets.

ENJOY:)
